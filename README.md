# Getting Started with Create React App
A simple navbar that is responsive with a border around each page. Nothing fancy but can be modified as needed. 

The goal wasn't to create something complex but something rather easy to display on the browser. 

Feel free to modify as you'd like, adding some basic react tests as there aren't any. 

I cleaned out some files so you will need to add test files.



To run this project just do the following:

- [ ] Download the zip file or clone the repo but you will need an ssh key as using a sign in is no longer supported on GitHub.
- [ ] The easiest way is to just download the zip and unzip the file to a folder 
- [ ] Then you will need to run `npm install` this will install of the needed dependencies there aren't many
- [ ] To make it easier as well we are using the font awesome link inside of the `index.html` file you can download font awesome to your project if modification is needed.
- [ ] We really don't want to be adding links in the html file but it was just something to make it easier to follow
- [ ] Starting the project consists of just running from the terminal `npm start` and the page should open up with the following displaying in the terminal
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view react-responsive-appbar-demo in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.0.152:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

webpack compiled successfully
```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Good luck and hopefully this helps to get you started on a project that needs a navbar that is responsive
